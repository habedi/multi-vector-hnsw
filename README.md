A Java implementation of HNSW with multi-vector search support

</div>

---

Multi-vector HNSW is a Java library that provides an implementation of
the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm with support for indexing and searching of multi-vector data.
It allows you to index objects represented by multiple high-dimensional vectors and perform approximate nearest neighbor searches efficiently.

In many real-world applications, objects can be represented by multiple vectors, such as images with multiple feature sets
or documents with multiple embeddings for different parts of the text.


### Features

- **Multi-vector support**: Index and search for objects represented by multiple high-dimensional vectors.
- **Easy to use**: Simple API for indexing and searching.
- **Fast search**: Efficient approximate nearest neighbor search using the HNSW algorithm.
- **Customizable distance metrics**: Choose from various distance metrics including Euclidean, Cosine, and Dot Product.
- **Memory-efficient**: Designed to handle large datasets with minimal memory overhead.
- **Java-based**: Written in pure Java 17+, and easily integrable into applications running on the JVM.
